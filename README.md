# EssentU - Prepare for your Future

## Overview

**EssentU** is a oneâ€‘stop shop for everything you need to survive your dorm life. 
When students first transition to University it can be a big change for them as they move away from their friends and family into the unknown
with a bit of both excitement and nervousness. In such a time period without a standardized place to shop and without the time to build a proper 
checklist it is easy to forget some necessities that are cruical to thrving in a dorm. That is where our project comes in as it has a prebuilt 
checklist consisting of items that were emphasized in their importance by previous freshman to guide rising freshman 
to fufill their needs in a efficient and effective manner.
